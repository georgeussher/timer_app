# timer_app

❗WIP❗
❓About: this is a project that has been borne out of a personal frustration of mine when cooking
that the standard phone timer app can only support one timer at a time. Having multiple timers 
would prove extremely useful in the kitchen. 
This project will be deployed once finished. For now, to view the project clone the repo and run with npm start.

💻Tech-stack:
